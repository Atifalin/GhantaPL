# Auction Bidding System Debugging - Jan 27, 2025

## Current Issues

### Primary Issue
Non-host participants are unable to place bids in active auctions. The system appears to receive the bid attempt but fails to update the auction state.

### Additional Issues
1. Winner notifications not showing:
   - When a player is won, other participants are not receiving toast notifications
   - Need to implement real-time notifications for auction winners

2. Missing UI Components:
   - Skipped players count not displayed in UI
   - Won players list not implemented
   - Need to add these to auction status display

## Debug Progress

### Logs from Client
```
(NOBRIDGE) LOG  Bid placed successfully
(NOBRIDGE) LOG  BiddingCard: handleBid {"amount": 20, "isPaused": false, "userBudget": 6730}
(NOBRIDGE) LOG  Attempting bid: {"amount": 20, "auction": "270ee9a8-c5d3-458e-9013-dab4e634cc6c", "user": "31fa231b-22bb-4677-8929-f290a0dd8238"}
(NOBRIDGE) LOG  Placing bid: 20
(NOBRIDGE) LOG  Auction change received: UPDATE {...}
(NOBRIDGE) LOG  Bid placed successfully
```

### Changes Made

1. Updated RLS Policy for Participant Bidding:
   - Fixed USING clause to properly check bid-related fields
   - Added WITH CHECK clause to validate bid updates
   - Removed problematic OLD/NEW references

2. Fixed Realtime Subscriptions:
   - Added proper exception handling for duplicate tables
   - Ensured all auction-related tables are in realtime publication

### Next Steps

1. Test the updated RLS policy with non-host participant bidding
2. Monitor logs for:
   - RLS policy violations
   - Realtime subscription status
   - Bid update attempts
   - Database errors

3. If issues persist, investigate:
   - Participant role verification
   - Budget update logic
   - Realtime subscription handling

4. Implement missing features:
   - Add winner notifications using realtime subscriptions
   - Create UI components for skipped and won players
   - Add toast notifications for auction events
